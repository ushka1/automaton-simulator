# TODO

## High Priority

1. Add docstrings.
1. Better naming for `HistoryProxy` and `PathPublisher`.

## Medium Priority

## Low Priority

## Ideas

1. Add matchers for the router.
1. Think about another `Route`-like custom element, that is a `<div>` containing `<template>` listening to `PathPublisher` path changes and accordingly rendering/removing its content.
